# Face_Recognition_attendance_system

Technologies Used:
Python Version: 3.9.0
Database: MySQL (via XAMPP server)
Libraries: OpenCV, face recognition algorithm

 This system is designed to automate the process of marking attendance by recognizing faces through a webcam. It employs the OpenCV library for capturing and processing images, and uses a face recognition algorithm to accurately detect and identify registered users. Once a face is recognized, the system marks the attendance and stores the data securely in the MySQL database. This project helps eliminate the need for manual attendance, reduces the chances of proxy attendance, and provides a fast, contactless, and efficient solution for managing attendance in educational institutions or workplaces.
